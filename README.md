# BLE control App for MIT App Inventor - ESP32
Source code for MIT App inventor and the ESP32 for a simple BLE controller. For creation of the app I use the MIT app inventor in combination with the MIT AI2 Companion. I have tested this on an Android phone. I have heard in the meantime that unfortunately MIT App Inventor does not support BLE for the Iphone yet. Please make sure your ESP32 has Bluetooth to make this work. Note that some older ESP32 will not work with MIT App Inventor:
